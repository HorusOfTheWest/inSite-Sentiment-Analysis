To take a stand against the \u201cwith us or against us\u201d mentality that we are subject to on so many fronts on a daily basis and accept all aspects of ourselves so that we can truly make inroads in the spiritual evolution of humanity.\n\nI was meditating a few days ago on the yin yang symbol \u262f\ufe0f - here, we see the ever-changing nature of light and shade, also showing us that there is dark in the light and light in the dark. If we attempt to cut the dark from the light or vice versa, we simply cut off an aspect of divinity, and further remove ourselves from source. The yin yang is a wonderful symbol to teach and remind us that change is fundamental in life and that light and shade belong in balance. \n\nLet\u2019s choose to shine this perspective brightly in 2022 for the highest good.\n\n#tarot #thothtarot #twoofcups #twoofswords #thehighpriestess #leopardtarot #peace #love #balance #harmony #intuition #spiritualevolution #humanity #reconciliation #polarities #duality #choice #highestgood #divine #source #yinyang #change #light #shade #dark #shadowwork #lightworker #growth #wisdom #spirit"

Firstly, there needs to be forgiveness from the party that was hurt. Forgiveness does not mean that you condone the wrong-doing -it means that you choose not to hold on to it any longer.\n\nReconciliation is only possible if both parties are willing and prepared to put in the effort to rebuild trust. The offending party needs to show true remorse & apologize - not just verbally, but through changed behaviour. Reconciliation is a process. It takes time to rebuild trust. \n\nThere are instances where reconciliation is not possible -or healthy. This might be when the hurt was so bad that one can forgive but chooses not to rebuild a relationship. This is okay. Reconciliation is also not possibly when there is no true remorse or accountability. It is not possible to just move forward without this.\n\nWhen deciding whether to reconcile or not, think about what will bring you the most peace \u262e\ufe0f\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n. \n\n#rakhibeekrum #psychologist\n\n_____________________________________________\n\n#dayofreconciliation #reconciliation #durban #durbannorth #southafrica #umhlanga #psychologistsofinstagram #psychologistsouthafrica #therapistsofinstagram #proudlysouthafrican #southafricanhistory #forgivenessisfreedom #nationbuilding #brokenrelationships #trustissues #seekforgiveness #changedbehavior"
