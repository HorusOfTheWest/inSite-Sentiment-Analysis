Step two, replace local systems of belief with the fear of, and obedience toward, an Old Testament God, and the attached cosmology, which finishes the process of exorcism\u2026animate or sentient aspects of nature, including weather, features of the landscape, and the concept of other creatures as speaking, acting, or as spiritually endowed beings, remained possible only in the provinces of myth and fiction.\" \u2800\u2800\n\u2800\u2800\nChristianity is predicated upon the god-embodiment of the man Jesus Christ, and is therefore human-centric. In contrast, most indigenous cosmologies are Land-based, animist, and emphasises the interconnectedness of humans with all of creation. For me personally, wellness is the reclaiming and understanding of this truth which indigenous elders have understood throughout the ages; that we do not exist in a world made for humans, but in a greater web of purpose and interconnectedness with all earthly beings. \u2800\n\u2800\nHumans are not the centre of the universe, and we must learn our humble place. \u2800\n\u2800\u2800\nPhotograph of Nias women in Sumatra, Indonesia, unknown source (retrieved from Pinterest).\u2800\u2800\n\u2800\u2800\n#decolonize #spirituality #indigenousspirituality #morethanmyths #decolonizeyourmind #decolonizespirituality #decolonizechristianity #ancestors #animism #decolonizewellness #indonesian #womenofcolour #sumatra #indonesianwomen #indigeneity"

That's not to say that S\u00e1mi society prior to colonization was matriarchal, but there is evidence to suggest that with colonization also came a change in the structural relations between genders and sexualities.\n\nHeteropatriarchy have worked, and very much continue to marginalize and invalidate Indigenous queerness. Often we are told that being queer or the notion of queerness works against Indigenous and  traditional values. But ask yourself this, is it traditional to adhere to values introduced and enforced by colonialism? \n\nThe month of June has universally been recognized as a time to celebrate the diversity of sexuality and gender, subverting the tropes that continue to push the narrative that the world we live in is intrinsically binary with only two genders, and where the only relationships approved of and validated happens between a binary opposition.\n\nIn that sense, Pride should also be an important decolonizing event. \n\nI really hope that whatever you do this month to celebrate or commemorate Pride, you do it in the spirit of decolonization.\n\nStart by centering indigeneity and include Two-Spirit, queer, intersection and asexual as equally valid ways in which people choose to identify, or more to the point , in which Indigenous people choose to identify.\n\nBy using 2slgbtqia+ you help build space where Indigenous communities may feel included, and if that's not celebrating the essence of Pride, I really don't know what is.\n\n\ud83d\udcf8 @koronja____ \n\n@oslopride 2019\n\n#s\u00e1mi #s\u00e1pmi #pride #2slgbtqia #indigenousqueer #samiqueer #decolonizingpride #decolonizingspaces #indigeneity #fluidity #indigeniussolidarity"

If you know a little about my life story, you know that I could have ended up \u201cwhite\u201d and \u201cstraight\u201d lol. I grew up with only one side of my family, the white Latina side, and was the only brown person. I grew up Southern Baptist. I was taught from an early age that homosexuality was \u201cwrong in God\u2019s eyes.\u201d As a little one, I took that to believe that *I* was wrong in God\u2019s eyes. I didn\u2019t come out to my family as queer until I was 32 years old. This was the same year, 10 years ago now,  that I met my father and I learned that we\u2019re Yaqui. Of course, I\u2019ve always been Indigenous, not only by blood but through my natural connection and inclination to the earth, as well as to the ethereal. My queerness, my two-spiritness, is an expression of my #wholeness and that\u2019s where it ties into my #indigeneity.\nIn 2014 I made a public prayer to \u201cbe who I truly am\u2019\u201d. This prayer was my humble attempt to heal from the lifetimes, over 500 years and over 4,000 ancestors, who were either *forced* to assimilate aka to be who they were not OR they were the *enforcers*, the colonizers, the killers of wholeness. The more Indigenous I\u2019m *being* the more queer I feel, the more *real* I feel. I\u2019m so grateful to be me. To have finally found me, after over 40 years. To be out. To be whole. I\u2019m so grateful to be Indigenous or more accurately #Yo\u2019eme and I\u2019m also so grateful to be queer AF.

            "caption": "Today marks the end of my first session as both an arts educator and an Indigenous educator. I\u2019ll get all new student on Monday but I\u2019m not sure if \u201cbaamaapi\u201d will get an easier. The hardest part out of all of this is not knowing if I\u2019m doing my job well, working to de-center myself as an instructor while also giving a part of myself away to all of my students. \n\nIn class, I talk of the wild rice beds along the river, about the danger of pipelines like Line 3 and Line 5 along the Straits of Mackinaw. I address the wild peppermint next to the lake as my friend, I teach animal names in Anishinaabemowin and greet my kids with \u201cAaniin, boozhoo!\u201d I am one of the first generations of Anishinaabeg to teach my language in classroom on my ancestral homelands without fear. I talk about who my people are and I tell them about how we lived along with the land. I talk to them about the crisis of missing and murdered Indigenous women, girls, two-spirits, and trans femmes and the legacy of residential schools. I talk about what the world was like before Columbus got lost or before we knew the footsteps of European settlers. I talk about queerness and gender. Most of my kids are only 10 or 11, so they ask about Pocahontas\u2014and I tell them the truth. Her name was Matoaka and she was taken from her people, married someone she didn\u2019t love, and was buried under an English name. I say \u201cmiigwetch\u201d and \u201cnishin!\u201d and teach them how to introduce themselves in Anishinaabemowin. Everyday I\u2019m proud to be Anishinaabe, everyday I\u2019m proud to be Indigenous, and everyday I\u2019m proud to be NDN. \n\nThis is my version of reclamation. This is how I assert my Indigeneity in inherently colonized spaces. This is how we unsettle the settler frame of mind. \n\n#unsettlethesettler #indigeneity #twospirit #arteducation"
