I love and believe in this movement and in all the good it has achieved, which is why I'm so keen to make it even better.\n\nNot everyone feels like permaculture is 'their' movement. Not everyone feels it acknowledges them, or speaks to their needs. But projects including @liberationpermaculture, @perma.queer and @global.permayouth are out to turn this around.\n\nIf you'd like to dive deeper into the ideas in this illustration, I'd highly recommend downloading issue #98 of @permaculturedesignmagazine on Decolonising Permaculture. It's packed with important and exciting ways to help move this global movement forward on issues of race, equality and social justice.\n\n\"We request that as we reconnect with the land through the practice of permaculture, the permaculture community actively seeks out and publicly acknowledges both the history and current reality of the land as it relates to struggles against colonisation, conquest and oppression\" - the People of Colour Caucus at the NAPC.\n\nThis stuff is important, not just for permies but for everyone working to make a difference wherever they are.\n\nLet us know in the comments what resources you'd recommend to break down barriers and make the movement stronger.\n\n#artasactivism #brennaquinlan #permacultureillustrator"
