            "caption": "Repost @intothewolvesdenthemovie - There are four Native American Indian Spirituality Laws that say nothing happens for no reason in life. When you do understand this, \nit's very easy to handle and you confidently look at what's happening, thankful for what was there and happy for what's going to happen.\n\nThe 1st law says:\n\u2032\u2032 The person you meet is the right one \u2032\u2032\nThat is, no one comes into our lives by accident, all the people around us who interact with us, stand for something, either to educate us or to help us in our situation.\n\nThe 2nd law says:\n\u2032\u2032 What happens is the only thing that can happen \u2032\u2032\nNothing but absolutely nothing of what happens to us could have been different. Not even the most insignificant detail. There just isn't \u2032\u2032 If I had done it differently... It would have been different...\" No, what happens is the only thing that can happen and needs to happen, so we can learn our lessons to get ahead. Everything, yes, every situation that happens to us in life is absolutely perfect, even when our spirit resists our ego and doesn't want to accept it.\n\nThe 3rd law says:\n\u2032\u2032 Every moment when something starts is the right time \u2032\u2032\nEverything starts at the right time, not sooner or later. When we are ready for something new in our life, it's already there to begin with.\n\nThe 4th law says:\n\u2032\u2032 What's over is over \u2032\u2032\nIt's that simple. When something ends in our life, it serves our development. That's why it's better to let go and move forward, bestowed on the experiences that have now been gained.\n\nI don't think it's a coincidence that you're reading this here. If this text meets you today, it's because you meet the conditions and understand that no rain drop anywhere in the world accidentally falls \nin the wrong place.\nLet it go well...\nLove with your whole being...\nBeing happy without end...\nEvery day is a happy, happy day. \n\u2764\ufe0f \nI Am. \nYou Are.\nWe Are.\nOneness.\n#nativeamerican #nativeamericanwisdom #nativeculture #mmiwg #heal #itstopsnow #betheirvoice #justiceforall \n#intothewolvesden #likeforlikes #insta #film #supportindiefilm #actors #director #music #whywewerered #nativeart #artist \n#lakota #Ojibwa #savannasact #nomorestolensisters"

To achieve this, they needed to separate us from this relationship by forced removal from our traditional lands and limiting our access to cultural land practices that are built on reciprocity rather than resource extraction. \n\nThey even went so far as to destroy the thriving ecosystems of the land in an attempt to drive starvation of traditional resources (such as Buffalo massacres), in order to enact genocide and land theft. \n\nFurther colonial oppression was established by introducing patriarchal governance (Indian Act Chiefs), targeting women and children through violence and breaking family units and breaking traditional knowledge inheritance through use of the Residential School System. \n\nContinuing to this day the colonial system makes it illegal for us to fight for stolen land. \n\nAnd they make it nearly impossible to fight for our babies that are STILL stolen from us by the government! \n\nAll these things are connected as pieces of a systematic attack on our Indigenous ways of being in relationship with the Land, our mother. \n\nFor these reasons and many more, we say LAND BACK. \n\n\ud83c\udf3f\n\nWant to learn more about the connection to Land?
