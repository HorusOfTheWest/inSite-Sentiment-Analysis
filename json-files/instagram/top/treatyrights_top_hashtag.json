The police physically remove and arrest peaceful pipeline protesters in BC, but stand by and watch violent mobs in the Maritimes? \n\nDid this just happen? \n\nAnd there is something that doesn't add up about this claim that the Mi'kmaw fishers are threatening stocks: \n\n\"Sipekne\u2019katik First Nation has seven licenses and only three are being used at the moment. Each license has 50 traps for a total of 150 traps. The commercial fishery in that zone, which is much bigger than just St. Mary\u2019s Bay, allows for up to 390,000 traps.\" \n\nhttps://www.aptnnews.ca/national-news/the-facts-behind-mikmaw-fishing-rights/\n\nIn other words, the Mi'kmaw fishers hold and use a fraction of one per cent of licenced traps. Unless I'm missing something significant, this doesn't appear to be about conservation or significant threat to other's livelihood.\n\n#Mikmaq #AllEyesOnMikmaki #TreatyRights #cdnpoli #settlerviolence"

The banks involved in that loan have to make a decision whether to continue to support Line 3 or walk away from Enbridge.\n\nThose banks include @Chase, @Citi, @BankofAmerica, @RBC & @TDbank_US. If you bank with them - you should move your money. And either way, you should join our push to force them to face up to their #ClimateResponsibilities. \n\n#StopTheMoneyPipeline #MoveYourMoney #ClimateFinance #IndigenousRights \n\nArt by @JackieFawn"

With the pipeline nearing completion, demonstrators called on @mngovernor and @potus to pull permits on the project, which will transport more than 800,000 barrels of crude tar sands oil a day across hundreds of pristine northern MN rivers and wetlands, risking oil spills and violating Anishinaabe treaty rights in the process. Throughout this week, a smaller contingent of people have been camping out on the Capitol lawn to put pressure on politicians.\n\nFor @bloomberg \n\n#stopline3 #waterprotectors #climatecrisis #minnesota #waterislife #blacksnake #protest #stpaulmn #treatyrights #indigenous #indigenousrights #mmiw #greennewdeal"
