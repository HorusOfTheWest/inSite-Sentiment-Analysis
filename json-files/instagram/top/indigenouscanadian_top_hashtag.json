Available for purchase directly from the artist.\n.\n.\n\ud83c\udfaf @houlefineart\n.\n.\n\ud83c\udf41 Cody Houle (Stalking Heron Art) is an Anishinaabe artist from southwestern Ontario, Canada. \n.\n.\n\ud83c\udfa8 A self-taught painter, Houle began painting at the age of thirty-one after going through major bouts of depression. Painting gave him a outlet instead of holding everything in.\n.\n.\n\ud83d\udd8c\ufe0f Though drawn to abstract visuals it is the woodland paintings that often resonate most for Houle and his sense of his culture.\n.\n.\n\ud83e\udd85 Growing up, Houle felt shame and guilt surrounding his Native identity; now, his art allows him to show pride and strength in being an Indigenous man.  Houle believes it is important to share art to inspire hope and encourage anyone to create.\n.\n.\n\ud83d\udc68\ud83c\udffd\u200d\ud83c\udfa8 About his art, Cody says: \"I am trying to show Indigenous youth that art can be whatever we want to create. We don't have to stay in the box that was set aside for us as Indigenous artists. That our art can occupy any space\".\n.\n.\n#CodyHoule #HouleFineArt #Anishinaabe #AnishinaabeArtist #IndigenousArtist #CanadianArtist #OntarioArtist #Canada #CanadianArtDaily #AbstractArt #Abstract #ColourfulArt #Indigenous #NativePride #FristNations #DiscoverCanada #ExploreCanada #IndigenousCanadian #DiscoverOntario #FineArt #ArtCollectors #DailyArt #Art"
