Out of this sense of hopelessness and anger came an annual march on Valentine\u2019s Day to express compassion, community, and caring for all women in Vancouver\u2019s Downtown Eastside on unceded Coast Salish territories.\n\nThe memorial march continues to honour the lives of missing and murdered women, and all women\u2019s and gender-diverse peoples\u2019 lives lost in the Downtown Eastside. Increasing deaths of many women and gender-diverse people from the DTES still leaves family, friends, loved ones, and community members with an overwhelming sense of grief and loss. Indigenous women, girls, two spirit and trans people disproportionately continue to go missing or be murdered with minimal to no action to address these tragedies or the systemic nature of gendered violence, poverty, racism, or colonialism.\" \n(womensmemorialmarch.wordpress.com)\n\nJoin us February 14 at noon, Terrace City Hall as we hold space for our murdered and missing Kin.

Please read as this means a lot to me:\n\nMay 5th is MMIW awareness day. Yes it\u2019s a couple months away but I want to start working on this and start spreading awareness. Those who want to help spread awareness that day with the \u201cNo More Stolen Sisters\u201d picture\u201d I will provide the red paint and take the photo of you in my studio so you can post it on your social media May 5, 2022 to help spread awareness. \n\nIf you\u2019re still with me and reading, thank you:\n\nWhy is it so important to spread awareness? \n\nHere\u2019s just a few facts:\nEight days.\nThat\u2019s how long it took to find Gabby Petito. \n\nWhen Rae Elaine Tourtillott, an 18-year-old member of the Menominee tribe, disappeared in 1986, it took authorities six months to locate her. When 22-year-old Katelyn Kelley went missing, it was nine months before her remains were found.\n\nThe government is so quick to tell native people to be quiet or silence us. \n\n5,712 known cases of missing or murdered native women in 2016. Only 116 were LOGGED in the DOJ database. Since 2016 we\u2019ve lost count. \n\nMost cases did NOT happen on reservation land. \n\nI think about it all the time how I could have been one of these statistics. When I was a child I was almost kidnapped. I remember all the details of the situation. \n\n67% the number of cases between 2005-2009 the US attorney declined to prosecute involving sexual abuse. \n\n96% of the cases on some reservations the number of sexual violence against native women were committed by non-natives. \n\nA picture is worth a thousand words. Help bring awareness that we don\u2019t want to be silenced anymore\u2026so we don\u2019t have anymore stolen sisters. \n\nPhoto used is not mine but to reference what no more stolen sisters looks like of what would be taken of you. \n\n#MMIW #MMIWawareness #MMIWday #NoMoreStolenSisters #NativePride"
